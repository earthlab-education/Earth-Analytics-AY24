I added the html file in this folder but it can also be found 
![here](https://brglea.github.io/notebooks/06_urban_greenspace_denver/portfolio_post_urban_greenspace.html).

I am having with one image rendering in the data description section - I have 
saved as a screenshot so, I'm able to see in in VS Code but not here. This is a problem 
in a few of my portfolio posts from last semester and would love to know how to fix that.
